          Ryan Dahl (born 1981) is an American software engineer who is best known for creating the Node.js JavaScript
          runtime as well as the Deno JavaScript/TypeScript runtime.

          Dahl grew up in San Diego, California. His mother bought him an Apple IIc when he was six years old, one of his
          first experiences with technology. Dahl attended a community college in San Diego and later transferred into UC San
          Diego where he studied mathematics. He went on to attend grad school for Mathematics at the University of Rochester
          where he studied algebraic topology, which he found "very abstract and beautiful" for a couple of years but later
          got bored of it because "it was not so applicable to real life".

          After graduating, Dahl entered a Ph.D. program, but eventually dropped out, since he did not want to devote the
          rest of his life to mathematics. Instead, he left for South America, where he started developing web applications
          in Ruby.

          On May 27, 2009, Dahl released his project, the Node.js framework. In January 2012, after having worked on the
          Node.js project since 2009, Dahl announced that he would step away from the project and turn operational management
          over to NPM creator and former Joyent employee Isaac Z. Schlueter. Dahl gave the following reason for moving on
          from the project:
