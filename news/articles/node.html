        <h1>Node.js 16.0.0 (Current)</h1>
        <h3>
          Node.js 16.0.0 is here! This new major version of Node.js brings a range of new features and significant changes to
          the platform.
        </h3>
        <p>
          <br />
          As always a new version of the V8 JavaScript engine brings performance tweaks and improvements as well as keeping
          Node.js up to date with JavaScript language features. In Node.js v16.0.0, the V8 engine is updated to V8 9.0 — up
          from V8 8.6 in Node.js 15. This update brings the ECMAScript RegExp Match Indices, which provide the start and end
          indices of the captured string. The indices array is available via the .indices property on match objects when the
          regular expression has the /d flag.
          <br />
          <br />
          The nature of our release process means that new features are released in the ‘Current’ release line approximately
          every two weeks. For this reason, many recent additions have already been made available in the most recent Node.js
          15 releases, but are still relatively new to the runtime. Some of the recently released features in Node.js 15,
          which will also be available in Node.js 16, include: Experimental implementation of the standard Web Crypto API npm
          7 (v7.10.0 in Node.js v16.0.0) Node-API version 8 Stable AbortController implementation based on the
          AbortController Web API Stable Source Maps v3 Web platform atob (buffer.atob(data)) and btoa (buffer.btoa(data))
          implementations for compatibility with legacy web platform APIs
