        <h1>Car Shortage</h1>
        <h3>The global chip shortage is affecting the auto industry, with carmakers cutting production and dealerships</h3>
        <p>
          <br />
          Next year could be the light at the end of the tunnel for the chip shortage that slashed vehicle inventory for the
          past two years — and that could mean good news for weary car buyers.  The chip shortage has pummeled the global
          auto industry for years, depressing dealership inventory levels and driving up new and used vehicle prices. But
          experts from AutoForecast Solutions say that by the end of 2022, the semiconductor shortage won't be nearly as bad
          as it was last year. Better yet, 2023 could look even rosier.  Since 2020, auto companies have sacrificed
          production levels and valuable features like heated seats, while prioritizing money-making vehicles. In 2021,
          automakers built 3.23 million fewer vehicles than expected in North America because of the chip shortage. This
          year, that shortfall's on pace to hit about 1.5 million, per an AutoForecast Solutions estimate last week. 
          <br />
          <br />
          Rivian "saw a number of challenges in terms of the semiconductor space, as well as just overall ramping of the
          volume within our supply base," CEO RJ Scaringe said in a second-quarter earnings call earlier this year. (One
          benefit to electric, though, is that EVs require the more complex chips that chip companies are eager to make,
          unlike the antiquated, less profitable chips that older cars require.) Next year's potential chip shortage respite
          could bring relief to car shoppers if inventory levels recover, pushing down prices.  Still, automakers remain
          vigilant, and continue to cut back on production — and experts at management consulting firm Alvarez and Marsal
          don't think the industry will be out of the woods just yet.
