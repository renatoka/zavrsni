        <h1>Nature is Beautiful</h1>
        <h3>Nature is the most beautiful thing in the world.</h3>
        <p>
          <br />
          Nature has given us so much that we cannot even imagine. Life on this earth is possible only because of nature.
          There are many other planets in the universe but without this nature life is not possible there. Thus nature is the
          basis of our life. Nature is not the same everywhere on earth. According to the place, nature changes its
          appearance and according to that place provides us with resources, as well as provides comfort to our mind, our
          eyes. Nature gives us so much, so it is our duty to respect it knowing its importance and not to destroy it for our
          selfishness. So that the children of man can also enjoy its beauty and take advantage of it, otherwise one day will
          be when people will be able to see and feel the beauty of this nature on the computer itself.
